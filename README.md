- 👋 Hi, I’m Jhaylance Hilario, also known as @voidexocodex
- 👀 I’m interested in the journey of becoming a Full-Stack Developer starting from zero. 
- I was one of those people that fell off the learning curve when faced with a multitude of problems in Programming that eventually led me to complete and utter burnout for a couple of months.
- (Will be including a link to a blog post later on explaining the burnout)
- But recently, I picked up programming again, but I wanted a roadmap.
- 🌱 And as of June 18, 2021, I'm using The Odin Project as my clear starting point and my roadmap to Web Development.
- I truly believe that The Odin Project will provide me the research materials that will guide me towards my goal and pass through the infamous "Cliff of Confusion" that I previously fell off of a couple months ago.
- And hopefully later on, I will soon be able to apply my dormant knowledge of my programming experience into my projects for my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any Web Development projects provided by those that I'll be able to gain experience from, regardless of the challenges it provides.
- 📫 You can reach me through Discord @voidexocodex#4882
